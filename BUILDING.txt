Building Titokone requires Maven 2 or greater. The resulting
executable JAR can be found from the /target directory.

  mvn clean verify

This project is configured to use PIT (pitest.org) to produce a test
coverage report (line coverage & mutation coverage). The reports will
be written in the /target/pit-reports directory.

  mvn clean verify -Pcoverage-report

Releasing new versions can be done with Maven Release Plugin (not yet
configured).
