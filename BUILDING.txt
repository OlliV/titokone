Building Titokone requires Maven 2+ and is done with the command:

  mvn clean verify

The resulting executable JAR can be found from the /target directory.

Right now the tests have not yet been updated (they haven't been updated
since 2004), so the build is failing. Running the tests can be skipped with:

  mvn clean verify -DskipTests

Producing a test coverage report (line coverage & mutation coverage) can be
done with the command:

  mvn clean verify -Pcoverage-report

Releasing new versions can be done with Maven Release Plugin (not yet configured).
